        We love welcoming larger groups who bring the right vibe to add to the
        energy and experience that our properties have to offer. However, we’re
        not suitable for all large groups. For that reason, we ask that groups
        of ten guests or more request approval prior to making their
        reservation. If pre-approval isn’t secured for reservations larger than
        ten guests, Lost Hostel reserves the right to cancel reservations larger
        than ten guests at any time. <br></br> <br></br>Organized tour companies
        that are interested in staying with us during their organized tours
        should definitely reach out. We love working with tour groups that have
        a similar approach to travel like us! We offer contracted rates and easy
        transaction processes.
